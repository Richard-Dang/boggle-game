List as many words that contain three letters or more by using 
the assorted letters found in the 4x4 cube grid within 3 minutes.
Words can only be formed from adjoining letters which means that 
they will join either vertically, horizontally or diagonally. 
Additionally, no single letter cube can be used more than once 
to make a word. Good Luck!
Scores will be totalled depending on how many correct words are
made and their corresponding number of letters.
